## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v18` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v9`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
$ cd cdp-node-frontend-template
$ nvm use
```

## Local development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

### Local JSON API

Whilst the APIs are being developed this app uses a local JSON mock API. To start this locally run:

```bash
$ npm run mockApi
```

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
$ npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json)
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
$ npm run
```

## Versioning

### Auto minor versioning

The [Publish GitHub Actions workflow](./.github/workflows/publish.yml) auto versions a Pull Requests code with a `minor`
version once it has been merged into the `main` branch.
All you have to do is commit your code and raise a Pull Request and the pipeline will auto version your code for you.

### Major or Patch versioning

If you wish to `patch` or `major` version your codebase use:

```bash
$ npm version <patch|major>
```

Then:

- Push this code with the auto generated commit to your GitHub Repository
- Raise a Pull Request
- Merge your code into the `main` branch
- The [Publish GitHub Actions workflow](./.github/workflows/publish.yml) will tag and push your `major` or `patch`
  version tags to your GitHub Repository
- The [Publish GitHub Actions workflow](./.github/workflows/publish.yml) will release your `major` or `patch`
  versioned code
